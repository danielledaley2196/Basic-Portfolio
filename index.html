                    I have spent near a decade in retail customer service work, and most of that has been as some type of manager.
                    It started as night manager of a little cafe while I was sitll in highschool, and just exploded from there. 
                    Currently I am one of the youngest Retail Store Managers in the state. I manage of a mid-volume state liquor store. 
                    My particular store is busier in the summer time than it is in the winter. Mostly because we get a lot of the traffic 
                    from the beach due to our location.We are the store that is directly between the most used exit and entry for the beach 
                    from the back roads. The rest of the  year other than the townie traffic we get some of the people coming off of Route 1.

                    I spend what little free time I actually have doing leisurely activities. Mostly reading, knitting or hiking. I started knitting 
                    when I was about eight years old and my grandmother needed somethng to keep me entertainded after school one day. I've managed to 
                    knit a few sweaters in the last few years. One most notably in just about two weeks over this last summer. I usually have my nose 
                    buried in some sort of text, usually a sci-fi or fantasy novel. I try to devote time every summer to read through the Harry Potter 
                    series at least once, and have actually managed to do it twice these last few years.
